       caption = "Source: Survey", #where we got the information from

       x = "Amount received") #counting how many ads have been received of each type on the x axis

type_bar
```

This graph shows the different types of advertisements that are received on Youtube. Using a bar graph allows us to compare the frequency of the different category of ads.

```{r}
viewed_bar <- latest_data %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(aes(y = seen_before)) +
  labs(title = "Ad seen before", #title for the graph
       caption = "Source: survey", #show where the information came from
       x = "Amount", #amount of ads on x axis
       y = "Answer") #answer of if the ad has been seen or not on y axis

viewed_bar
```

This graph tells us if a user has seen the ad received already.
